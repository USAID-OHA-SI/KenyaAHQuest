## Newly Initiated

From the National Data Warehouse (NDW), line list all clients who were newly initiated(TX_NEW) at any time between the period October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2023 (FY23). DO NOT double-report clients. De-identify the clients. Do not include any information that can identify them. Ensure the de-identified number can be used to link back to the client in case there is a need to address any data quality issues.

## Variable description

For each client listed, indicate the following variables: a). Implementing Partner - indicate the current implementing partner supporting the facility where the client receives ART treatment. b). Facility Name - facility or clinic where the client receives ART treatment. c). Facility MFL Code - facility or clinic master facility code where the client receives ART treatment. d). County â€“ the county where the facility is located. e). Client Number - the unique de-identified number allocated to the client for identification. f). Date of Birth - indicate the client's date of birth. The dates take the format DD/MM/YYYY. g). Sex - Male or Female. h). Date of HIV Diagnosis - indicate the date the client received an HIV-positive diagnosis. The dates take the format DD/MM/YYYY. i). Entry point at HIV Diagnosis - indicate the client's entry point at HIV diagnosis PMTCT, OPD, VCT, TB clinic e.t.c j). WHO stage at HIV Diagnosis - indicates the WHO clinical staging at diagnosis. k). Date of ART Initiation - indicates the date the client started the ART treatment. The dates take the format DD/MM/YYYY. l). ART Regimen at Initiation - indicate the client's ART regimen at treatment initiation. m). ART Regimen Line at Initiation - indicate whether the ART regimen indicated in (l) above is either first-line, second-line, or third-line. n). Current ART regimen - indicate the current ART regimen the client is on. o). Date of ART regimen change - if the current ART regimen is different from the ART regimen at initiation, then indicate the date when the change occurred. The dates take the format DD/MM/YYYY.
